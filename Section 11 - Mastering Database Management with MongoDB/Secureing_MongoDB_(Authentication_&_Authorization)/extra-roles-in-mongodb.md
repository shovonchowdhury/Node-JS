### **Which Additional Roles Should You Use?**
- **For managing replica sets** â†’ `clusterMonitor`, `clusterManager`
- **For backups and recovery** â†’ `backup`, `restore`
- **For security audits** â†’ `auditAdmin`
- **For sharding** â†’ `enableSharding`

These roles provide additional control in **specialized MongoDB deployments**. ðŸš€
